# Redux diagrams (desired state)

(using our conventions at https://magmo.gitbook.io/reference/developer-handbook/react-redux-conventions)

### Methodology

These flowcharts are made by constructing nodes from the _state types_ or (_stage types_ where indicated), from the relevant file in a `/states/` directory, and then constructing edges from the relationships defined in the relevant `/reducers/` directory. Edges are labelled with the _action types_ from the `/actions/` directory (or function calls such as other reducers), and the flowcharts suppress information about conditional checks that are performed by the reducers. Where useful, reducers have had their sub-reducers unpacked -- making for a fewer number of more complicated flowcharts. When a reducer returns the same state, these loops are also suppressed. Globally handled actions are also sometimes suppressed.

<!-- TODO: consider using the actual `string` value of the types, rather than the variable name. -->
<!-- TODO: related to ^, consider enforcing this string to be *exactly* the same as the type variable name -->
<!-- TODO: use hyperlinks / anchors to make this document easier to navigate. -->

### Key:

We initialize the wallet, but we open a channel.
